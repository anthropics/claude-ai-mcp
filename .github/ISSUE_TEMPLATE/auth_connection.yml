        Thanks for reporting an auth connection issue!

        Before submitting, please:
        - Replicate the issue again at the time of submission to confirm the problem still occurs
        - If this is not your server, check if another issue has already been filed for this server

        - Confirm this is related to OAuth or authentication (not a general MCP bug)
